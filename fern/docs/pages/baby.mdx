Baby Sheridan is growing bigger every week!

We have the nursery complete with gender neutral decor. The walls are painted a soft mint green, and we've added some woodland-themed decorations that will work perfectly regardless of whether we have a little boy or girl.

We will publish three pictures after the birth to this site, so stay tuned.

If you want to support us after the little one arrives, please refer to the [Support Page](support.mdx) for meal train sign-up and visiting hours.

🎉 BIG NEWS: We're having a baby! 🎉
