Welcome to the world, **Mia Kavich Sheridan**! We think Mia is a beautiful name and Kavich is a family maiden name.

Mia was born the morning of August 12, 2025 and weighed in at 8 pounds. She is an early birthday gift for Mom whose birthday is the next day. We already have a rule that they won't share birthday celebrations‚Äîthey deserve their own days.

## Appreciation

Shout out to the nurses, doctors, lactation consultants, meal service, and even cleaning staff at the hospital for their care and support. We're blessed to have such a wonderful team of professionals at NYU Langone to help us in this journey.

## Visitors

For local visitors, please reach out to Danny to coordinate time to pop by. We are excited to spend time with family and friends and invite you to join us!

Given baby's developing immune system, we are asking that you please reschedule your visit if you are sick.

## Meal Train

Want to help us out with a meal? We'd love your support! üçΩÔ∏è

After the baby arrives, we'll be adjusting to life as new parents and would appreciate having to plan one less meal. If you'd like to participate, **[sign up for our meal train](https://mealtrain.com/532z5r)**.

## Gifts

We are fortunate to have a thorough collection of hand-me-downs from siblings and friends. We have plenty of books, clothes, toys, blankets, and everything else to provide comfort to our baby. We are intentional about the number of physical items we keep in our home and would appreciate your support in other ways. 

Instead of physical gifts, how about:

1. Coming out to NY to spend time with us, let's go for a walk, chat, and break bread together. [preferred]
2. Writing a letter. Share about yourself, a piece of advice, and include a photo or two. We'll put your letter in a baby book we're curating.
3. Contributing to Mia Sheridan's 529 plan for college‚Äîplanning 18 years ahead! [Contribute below](#contribute-to-the-529-plan)
