Construction is well underway! The cabinets have been installed, but not painted, and tile has been installed and grouted. Next up is painting the walls, cabinets, trim, and doors. They are working on the septic system and rain water collection system, both necessary since we are outside the range of public utilities (aside from electricity).\

Weâ€™ve been shipping furniture and other house items to a warehouse in Austin and will be moving it into the house the first week of December.
