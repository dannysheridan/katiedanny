## Meals
For meals, we have a meal train spreadsheet with dates to sign up for a meal, a list of our favorite foods, and delivery instructions. [View our meal train spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10dsMra5lv5_lcSN2jvmYu4FG4i6FJhmIbZAykfGDmRg/edit?gid=0#gid=0).

## Gifts
We are intentional about the number of physical items we keep in our home and baby items are no exception. Thank you in advance for understanding our wish to limit the amount of "stuff" we own.

Here are our gift ideas in order of preference:

1. Come out to NY to spend time with us, let's go for a walk, chat, and break bread together. [preferred]
2. Write a letter. Old school, yeah. Share your advice, hopes, dreams with baby sheridan. We will keep your letter in a special book and gift it to them when they are older.
3. Donate to a local library in baby sheridan's name.

## Visitors
For local visitors, please reach out to Danny to schedule a time to pop by. We require you to not be actively sick with anything contagious and we ask for flexibility if we need to reschedule for any reason.
